## General info
The goal of the project is to detect cracks in concrete above and under water. 
Also detection of crack width and length.

	
## Technologies
Project is created with Neural Networks & Machine Learning:
* CNN
* K-Means Clustering / Densitity based Clustering
	
## Approach
First train on open source data from Kaggle. Train a CNN and a clustering algorithm.
Then try to train on data from SkyeBase.
